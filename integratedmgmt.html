                                    <strong>What is integrated management system?</strong>
                                    <br> It is a quality system that improves the process and service quality in your company
                                    and thus leads to increased efficiency within the system. How is this achieved? Quite
                                    simply, it is achieved purely with reduction in wastages and by better usage of resources
                                    and streamlining the current practices in the company.</p>
                                <p> There are many companies that implement an&nbsp;
                                    <a title="IMS Certification" href="https://www.irqs.co.in/ims-certification.html"
                                        itemprop="url">IMS certification</a>, but do not take in all the advantages they have. Because of the
                                    years of experience we have in the industry, IRQS understands the value of such practices
                                    and ensure that timely audits are carried out to keep the efficiency levels at its peak
                                    in your company. This will make sure that your employees are more motivated to work and
                                    want to achieve more within the system.</p>
                                <p>The biggest advantage of having such a system in place is that you would be able to understand
                                    the lacks and strengths of your company at all times. Every time you see a variation
                                    in the thorough-output, you would know the reasons for the variation and what needs to
                                    be changed. In simple terms, you would be able to shift the focus of different divisions
                                    in the company towards a single goal with an integrated management system.</p>
